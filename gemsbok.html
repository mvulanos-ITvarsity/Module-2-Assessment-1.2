            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
            <p>The gemsbok is a large antelope native to Southern Africa. It is light brownish-grey to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Its tail is long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg. The gemsbok has a muscular neck and shoulders, and its legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both front legs and both genders have long straight horns.</p>
