            <h3>LION</h3>
            <p>The roar of the mighty African Lion is one of the most iconic sounds of the African bush and can be heard up to 8 km away. Lions live in groups called prides, with up to 20-30 individuals. As the top predators in their ecosystem, they have adapted to catch prey bigger, faster, and stronger than them. As such, they also outcompete other large carnivores. Sadly, lion numbers are dropping across the African continent. Fortunately, the South African lion population is stable or increasing in major reserves. Although lions are listed as Least Concern, they do not occur outside of formally protected areas in South Africa.

Lions face similar threats to other large carnivores, but there has been an increase in targeted poisoning of Lions in protected areas and captive facilities. Because body parts and bones had been removed from the poisoned animals, we suspect a growing demand for these products in the illegal wildlife trade..</p>
