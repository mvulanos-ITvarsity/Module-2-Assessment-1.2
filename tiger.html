            <h3>TIGER</h3>
            <p>1. TIGERS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE A WHILE
Tigers were around about 2 million years ago.</p>
                <p>2. HOWEVER, THANKS TO HUMANS, TIGERS ARE NOW ENDANGERED
Over the last 150 years, the tigers' range has shrunk by nearly 95%. There are estimated to be around 3,900 tigers left in the wild.</p>
                <p>3. CAPTIVE VS WILD
There are more tigers in captivity in the US than are left in the wild. </p>
                <p>4.INDIA IS THE COUNTRY WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF WILD TIGERS
Around 3,000 of the world's wild tigers are in India></p>
                <p>5. SILENT HUNTERS
Tigers have soft toe pads which help them walk silently through their habitat. A tiger will typically travel 6-12 miles during a night’s hunting. During the day, a tiger’s stripes can act as camouflage, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings for stalking and ambushing its prey.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
